Great! Now we have a working base with:

1. Map parsing ✓
2. Player movement and collision ✓
3. Basic raycasting ✓
4. Textured walls ✓

Would you like to add some optimizations or bonus features? Here are some possibilities:

1. Minimap (showing player position and walls)
2. Mouse rotation (for smoother camera control)
3. Wall collision improvements (adding a small buffer to make movement smoother)
4. Sprint feature (increased movement speed while holding a key)
5. Texture animations
6. Doors that can be opened/closed

Which one would you like to implement first? Or is there something else you'd like to improve in the existing code?
