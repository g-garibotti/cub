Great! Now we have a working base with:

1. Map parsing ✓
2. Player movement and collision ✓
3. Basic raycasting ✓
4. Textured walls ✓
5. Minimap (showing player position and walls) ✓
6. Mouse rotation (for smoother camera control) ✓
7. Sprint feature (increased movement speed while holding a key) ✓

5. Texture animations
6. Doors that can be opened/closed

Which one would you like to implement first? Or is there something else you'd like to improve in the existing code?
